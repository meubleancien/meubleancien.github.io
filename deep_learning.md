<h1 align="center"> Deep Learning </h1>

* [Good textbook](https://www.deeplearningbook.org/)

* [Intuitions behind the Universal Approximation Theorem](https://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/chap4.html) and a more [detailed introduction](https://www.deep-mind.org/2023/03/26/the-universal-approximation-theorem/)

* [Running LLMs locally, good tuto](https://steelph0enix.github.io/posts/llama-cpp-guide/)

* DeepSeek innovation, [Multi-Head Latent Attention](https://towardsai.net/p/artificial-intelligence/a-visual-walkthrough-of-deepseeks-multi-head-latent-attention-mla-%EF%B8%8F)

* A bit of neuroscience (from 2020 tho), [here](https://www.insightsfromthebrain.com/)

* Are LLMs really [injective](https://www.arxiv.org/abs/2510.15511) ?
