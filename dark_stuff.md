<h1 align="center"> Dark stuff </h1>


* [How to build a compiler](https://austinhenley.com/blog/teenytinycompiler1.html)

* Not necessarily dark but didn't want to create a new page :([check that](https://learnxinyminutes.com/)

* From-logic-gate-to-big-machine [tutorial](https://www.nand2tetris.org/course)

* [Stack vs Heap](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/79923/what-and-where-are-the-stack-and-heap)

* [Let it loop](https://github.com/repomirrorhq/repomirror/blob/main/repomirror.md)

* Interesting ideas on [why](https://people.csail.mit.edu/rachit/post/why-study-programming-languages/) creating new programming languages (not so dark either)

* [Pickle discussion](https://blog.trailofbits.com/2021/03/15/never-a-dill-moment-exploiting-machine-learning-pickle-files/)

* A bunch of nice [little things](https://ratatui.rs/showcase/apps/). Again nothing dark here, I really have to create another markdown page.

* [This](https://dis.art/counterfeit-poast) is actually a bit dark (this page is getting big, life is dark !)
