## History

#### Geographical origins 

>Ethiopia, Kaffa

>800 A.D

>Goat herder Kaldi observing his energetic goats, reported that to a monk that turned into an energetic praying goat after consuming the roasted beans

#### Diffusion in the area

>Arabian peninsula, Yemen around 15th century (monks are slow), then up to turkey by the 16th century

>First appearance of "coffe houses", places for social activities (“Schools of the Wise.”)

>"Wine of Araby" began to spread, with pilgrims coming to Mecca 

#### Broader diffusion in europe

>17th century: coffee is in europe (Venetian merchants, first ever European coffee house was opened in Venice)

>As ususal, church banned it in Venice ("invention of satan") but the Pope liked it a lot

>Now a lot of coffe houses in England, France, Austria, Holland (not in Spain)

>"Penny universities" in England (1 penny = 1 coffee) : gathering places for academics, artists and intellectuals (London Stock Exchange idea >came from such place). Open places, no background checks

>"These coffeehouses were not hushed places of laptops and headphones. They were forums"

>"If you had wit and intelligence then you could take a seat at the coffeehouses, and, in all your many caffeinated discussions, you’d find there were few ideas left unexamined"

>Intellectual hubs

>"Anyone could learn, and anyone could teach, if only you could pay the price of a coffee, which, back then, was a penny"

>"Meanwhile, down at the Grecian Coffeehouse, scientists were gathering to watch two scholars dissect a dolphin on a table. Those scholars were Isaac Newton and Edmund Halley"

>Buuut strictly for men

>(I actually got interrupted while writing this to discuss important topics at the coffee machine)

>Another impact:better work quality (starting the day with a coffee is better then with a whisky)

>Paris also, at St Germain

>To the US, Boston Tea Party fostered coffee consumption (so far tea was preferred)

>Missionaries and travelers, traders and colonists continued to carry coffee seeds to new lands

>By the end of the 18th century, coffee had become one of the world's most consumed beverage
