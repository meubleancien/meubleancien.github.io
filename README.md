Find here some topics I am interested in, as I think they can have a real impact on many problems we face nowadays (or because they are just fun to investigate).

#### Conflicts, the dawn

Everything started with a period of unsolvable and fierce disagreements in a close family context. Most of the time, if not every, the dominant feelings resulting from
these fights were absurdity, inefficiency, blind anger, and animal primitivity (which can be fine sometimes, but not really with your mom and dad). Among all this, one question: is there any truth to follow, or a right behavior to adopt ? Actually no, let's be honest, the first quest was not about peace and fairness,  but about being the one who "wins" all of those stupid disputes, to prove them that you are mentaly better and stronger than they are. So how to achieve that ?
